  I am now at my second university, delving into Biotechnical Systems
  Engineering, with a focus on Mechatronics and Robotics, at the Polytechnic
  University of Bucharest. Previously, I devoted my time to studying Physical
  Therapy at "Dunărea de Jos" University in Galați. This transition mirrors my
  interest in technology and health, combining practical and theoretical
  knowledge for a holistic perspective. I enjoy integrating what I learn in both
  fields in a synergistic approach, bringing innovation and efficient solutions
  to healthcare and engineering.
